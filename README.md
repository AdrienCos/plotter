# Plotter

This Qt Python application connects to an SQL database generated by Sentinel to provide real-time plotting of the collected data.

## Installing

* Create a new virtual environment: `virtualenv venv`
* Activate it: `source venv/bin/activate`
* Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### MacOS: install pscopg2

Make sure OpenSSL is install with Brew. Type `export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib"`, and then install `pyscopg2` with `pip` or `pipenv`.

## Usage

* Configure the URL of the database you want to use in the `app_config.db_path` variable (see [here](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/core/engines.html) for more information).
* Run the app with `python app.py`


## Performance analysis

To profile the app in order to try and improve its performance, you can use the scripts in the `tools` folder. 

* `tools/profiling.py` runs `app.py` for 100 seconds and dumps the profile trace to a file called `result`
* `analyze.py` reads the `result` file and formats out its contents
